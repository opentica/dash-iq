# dash-iq

Custom dashboards and visualizations for AppD analytics data.

## Get started

Install NodeJS. You can either install it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ or install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) first, then run `nvm install v9`

**Install dependencies and start the `frontend`:**

* `cd ../frontend`
* `npm install`
* add info to `src/workflows.json` and `src/enterprises.json`
* create `.env.local` and set `REACT_APP_APPD_SERVER_URL` to point to your server, `REACT_APP_APP_KEY` if you want to restrict which browser app to get metrics from, and `REACT_APP_APPD_SERVER_URL` to point to the controller
* create `.env.development.local` with the same contents of `.env.local` but without `REACT_APP_APPD_SERVER_URL`

**Install dependencies and start the `server`:**

* `cd server`
* `npm install`
* create an file called `.env.local` and set `API_ACCOUNT_NAME` and `API_KEY` (you can look at `.env` for the format)
* `npm start`

Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

# Deployment

## Frontend

* `npm run build`
* copy the `build` folder to your production server

You now have static files that can be served with Apache, Nginx, or another web server. A simple way to serve them is:

* `npm install -g serve`
* `serve -s build`

## Backend

* `npm run build`
* Run the server with `API_ACCOUNT_NAME=xxxxxxx API_KEY=xxxxxx node bundle.js`

# Development

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you should install the extensions `ESLint` and `Prettier - Code formatter`
